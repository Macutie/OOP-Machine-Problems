/* 6. Create a Bus child class that inherits from the Vehicle class. The default fare 
charge of any vehicle is seating capacity * 100. If Vehicle is Bus instance, we 
need to add an extra 10% on full fare as a maintenance charge. So total fare for 
bus instance will become the final amount = total fare + 10% of the total fare. 
Note: The bus seating capacity is 50. so, the final fare amount should be 5500. 
You need to override the fare() method of a Vehicle class in Bus class. */
